selenium server and browser driver manager for your end to end tests. This is the same tool as `webdriver-manager` from the [Protractor](https://github.com/angular/protractor) repository.\n\n**Note:** Version 9 and lower please reference [pose/webdriver-manager](https://github.com/pose/webdriver-manager). If there are features that existed in version 9 and lower, please open up an issue with the missing feature or a create a pull request.\n\nGetting Started\n---------------\n\n```\nnpm install -g webdriver-manager\n```\n\nSetting up a Selenium Server\n----------------------------\n\nPrior to starting the selenium server, download the selenium server jar and driver binaries. By default it will download the selenium server jar and chromedriver binary.\n\n```\nwebdriver-manager update\n```\n\nStarting the Selenium Server\n----------------------------\n\nBy default, the selenium server will run on `http://localhost:4444/wd/hub`.\n\n\n```\nwebdriver-manager start\n```\n\nOther useful commands\n---------------------\n\nView different versions of server and driver files:\n\n```\nwebdriver-manager status\n```\n\nClear out the server and driver files. If `webdriver-manager start` does not work, try to clear out the saved files.\n\n```\nwebdriver-manager clean\n```\n\nOther topics:\n--------------\n\n- [mobile browser support](docs/mobile.md)\n- [protractor support](docs/protractor.md)\n","maintainers":[{"name":"angularcore","email":"angular-core+npm@google.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2017-01-06T22:20:44.759Z","created":"2014-06-29T23:53:12.742Z","0.0.1":"2014-06-29T23:53:12.742Z","0.0.2":"2014-06-29T23:59:50.913Z","0.0.3":"2014-06-30T00:05:56.380Z","0.0.4":"2014-06-30T00:11:40.161Z","0.0.5":"2014-07-08T15:32:19.526Z","0.0.6":"2014-07-08T15:46:27.280Z","0.0.7":"2014-07-11T23:25:26.462Z","0.0.8":"2014-08-31T19:00:02.592Z","1.0.0":"2014-10-29T12:37:16.961Z","1.0.1":"2014-11-15T22:40:29.096Z","2.0.0":"2014-12-23T12:56:14.559Z","3.0.0":"2015-03-11T15:50:08.514Z","4.0.0":"2015-04-15T18:40:15.164Z","5.0.0":"2015-04-19T00:48:10.238Z","5.1.0":"2015-05-18T14:11:48.453Z","5.2.0":"2015-05-19T17:10:31.734Z","5.3.0":"2015-06-09T18:12:48.032Z","6.0.0":"2015-06-09T18:15:19.061Z","6.0.1":"2015-07-08T13:37:59.943Z","6.0.2":"2015-07-08T13:40:15.736Z","7.0.0":"2015-07-19T20:58:39.155Z","7.0.1":"2015-07-20T11:32:33.083Z","8.0.0":"2015-12-20T15:45:54.845Z","9.0.0":"2016-03-20T20:46:21.171Z","10.0.0":"2016-04-26T23:32:33.634Z","10.0.1":"2016-04-26T23:47:05.637Z","10.0.2":"2016-05-24T17:30:14.169Z","10.0.3":"2016-06-08T01:59:56.661Z","10.0.4":"2016-06-08T17:18:07.341Z","10.1.0":"2016-06-27T21:18:11.638Z","10.2.0":"2016-07-01T00:57:59.474Z","10.2.1":"2016-07-11T21:24:51.251Z","10.2.2":"2016-08-08T21:22:01.532Z","10.2.3":"2016-08-24T18:34:36.943Z","10.2.4":"2016-10-14T20:14:03.065Z","10.2.5":"2016-10-24T20:01:16.597Z","11.0.0-beta.0":"2016-10-24T20:18:31.780Z","10.2.6":"2016-10-26T19:11:50.463Z","10.2.7":"2016-11-08T00:07:48.634Z","10.2.8":"2016-11-10T20:04:49.734Z","10.2.9":"2016-12-01T22:04:48.139Z","11.0.0":"2016-12-02T09:46:19.609Z","10.2.10":"2016-12-02T19:21:40.061Z","10.3.0":"2016-12-20T21:17:12.477Z","11.1.0":"2016-12-21T22:30:53.574Z","11.1.1":"2017-01-06T22:20:44.759Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/angular/webdriver-manager#readme","repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/angular/webdriver-manager.git"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/angular/webdriver-manager/issues"},"readmeFilename":"README.md","license":"MIT","users":{"koulmomo":true,"rabalos":true,"abdihaikal":true,"jaqbec":true,"denji":true,"gildasdubois":true,"juk":true,"rochejul":true},"keywords":["angular","test","testing","protractor","webdriver","webdriverjs","selenium","selenium-webdriver"],"author":{"name":"Craig Nishina","email":"craig.nishina@gmail.com"},"_attachments":{},"_etag":"W/\"5870183c-108ce\"","_lastModified":"Fri, 06 Jan 2017 22:20:44 GMT"}
