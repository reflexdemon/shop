<h1>Karma Webpack</h1>\n  <p>Use webpack to preprocess files in karma<p>\n</div>\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Install</h2>\n\n```bash\nnpm i -D karma-webpack\n```\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Usage</h2>\n\n``` javascript\n// Karma configuration\nmodule.exports = function(config) {\n  config.set({\n    // ... normal karma configuration\n    files: [\n      // all files ending in \"_test\"\n      {pattern: 'test/*_test.js', watched: false},\n      {pattern: 'test/**/*_test.js', watched: false}\n      // each file acts as entry point for the webpack configuration\n    ],\n\n    preprocessors: {\n      // add webpack as preprocessor\n      'test/*_test.js': ['webpack'],\n      'test/**/*_test.js': ['webpack']\n    },\n\n    webpack: {\n      // karma watches the test entry points\n      // (you don't need to specify the entry option)\n      // webpack watches dependencies\n\n      // webpack configuration\n    },\n\n    webpackMiddleware: {\n      // webpack-dev-middleware configuration\n      // i. e.\n      stats: 'errors-only'\n    }\n  });\n};\n```\n\n<h3 align=\"center\">Alternative Usage</h3>\n\nThis configuration is more performant, but you cannot run single test anymore (only the complete suite).\n\nThe above configuration generates a webpack bundle for each test. For many testcases this can result in many big files. The alterative configuration creates a single bundle with all testcases.\n\n``` javascript\nfiles: [\n  // only specify one entry point\n  // and require all tests in there\n  'test/test_index.js'\n],\n\npreprocessors: {\n  // add webpack as preprocessor\n  'test/test_index.js': ['webpack']\n},\n```\n\n``` javascript\n// test/test_index.js\n\n// require all modules ending in \"_test\" from the\n// current directory and all subdirectories\nvar testsContext = require.context(\".\", true, /_test$/);\ntestsContext.keys().forEach(testsContext);\n```\n\nEvery test file is required using the [require.context](http://webpack.github.io/docs/context.html#require-context) and compiled with webpack into one test bundle.\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Source Maps</h2>\n\nYou can use the `karma-sourcemap-loader` to get the source maps generated for your test bundle.\n\n```\nnpm install --save-dev karma-sourcemap-loader\n```\n\nAnd then add it to your preprocessors\n\n``` javascript\npreprocessors: {\n  'test/test_index.js': ['webpack', 'sourcemap']\n}\n```\n\nAnd tell webpack to generate sourcemaps\n\n``` javascript\nwebpack: {\n  // ...\n  devtool: 'inline-source-map'\n}\n```\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Options</h2>\n\nThis is the full list of options you can specify in your Karma config.\n\n### `webpack`\n\nWebpack configuration.\n\n### `webpackMiddleware`\n\nConfiguration for webpack-dev-middleware.\n\n### `beforeMiddleware`\n\n`beforeMiddleware` is a webpack option that allows injecting middleware before\nkarama's own middleware are run. This loader provides a `webpackBlocker`\nmiddleware that will block tests from running until code recompiles. That is,\ngiven this scenario:\n\n1. Have a browser open on the karma debug page (http://localhost:9876/debug.html)\n2. Make a code change\n3. Refresh\n\nWithout the `webpackBlocker` middleware karma will serve files from before\nthe code change. With the `webpackBlocker` middleware the loader will not serve\nthe files until the code has finished recompiling.\n\n***Note that the `beforeMiddleware` option is only supported in karma with version >1.0.***\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Maintainers</h2>\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <img width=\"150\" height=\"150\"\n        src=\"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4650931?v=3&s=150\">\n        </br>\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/MikaAK\">Mika Kalathil</a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <img width=\"150\" height=\"150\"\n        src=\"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8420490?v=3&s=150\">\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/d3viant0ne\">Joshua Wiens</a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1919664?v=3&s=150\">\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/goldhand\">Will Farley</a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <img width=\"150\" height=\"150\"\n        src=\"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1307954?v=3&s=150\">\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/DanielaValero\">Daniela Valero</a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <img width=\"150\" height=\"150\"\n        src=\"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/122108?v=3&s=150\">\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/jon301\">Jonathan Trang</a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <img width=\"150\" height=\"150\"\n        src=\"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3285723?v=3&s=150\">\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/carlos-\">Carlos Morales</a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  <tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">LICENSE</h2>\n\n> The MIT License (MIT)\n\n> Copyright (c) 2014 - 2016 Tobias Koppers\n\n> Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\n> The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\n> THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
