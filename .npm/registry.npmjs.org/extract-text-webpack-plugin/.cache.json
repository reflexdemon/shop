extract text plugin for webpack\r\n\r\n## Usage example with css\r\n\r\n``` javascript\r\nvar ExtractTextPlugin = require(\"extract-text-webpack-plugin\");\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n\tmodule: {\r\n\t\tloaders: [\r\n\t\t\t{ test: /\\.css$/, loader: ExtractTextPlugin.extract(\"style-loader\", \"css-loader\") }\r\n\t\t]\r\n\t},\r\n\tplugins: [\r\n\t\tnew ExtractTextPlugin(\"styles.css\")\r\n\t]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt moves every `require(\"style.css\")` in entry chunks into a separate css output file. So your styles are no longer inlined into the javascript, but separate in a css bundle file (`styles.css`). If your total stylesheet volume is big, it will be faster because the stylesheet bundle is loaded in parallel to the javascript bundle.\r\n\r\nAdvantages:\r\n\r\n* Fewer style tags (older IE has a limit)\r\n* CSS SourceMap (with `devtool: \"source-map\"` and `css-loader?sourceMap`)\r\n* CSS requested in parallel\r\n* CSS cached separate\r\n* Faster runtime (less code and DOM operations)\r\n\r\nCaveats:\r\n\r\n* Additional HTTP request\r\n* Longer compilation time\r\n* More complex configuration\r\n* No runtime public path modification\r\n* No Hot Module Replacement\r\n\r\n## API\r\n\r\n``` javascript\r\nnew ExtractTextPlugin([id: string], filename: string, [options])\r\n```\r\n\r\n* `id` Unique ident for this plugin instance. (For advanded usage only, by default automatic generated)\r\n* `filename` the filename of the result file. May contain `[name]`, `[id]` and `[contenthash]`.\r\n  * `[name]` the name of the chunk\r\n  * `[id]` the number of the chunk\r\n  * `[contenthash]` a hash of the content of the extracted file\r\n* `options`\r\n  * `allChunks` extract from all additional chunks too (by default it extracts only from the initial chunk(s))\r\n  * `disable` disables the plugin\r\n\r\nThe `ExtractTextPlugin` generates an output file per entry, so you must use `[name]`, `[id]` or `[contenthash]` when using multiple entries.\r\n\r\n``` javascript\r\nExtractTextPlugin.extract([notExtractLoader], loader, [options])\r\n```\r\n\r\nCreates an extracting loader from an existing loader.\r\n\r\n* `notExtractLoader` (optional) the loader(s) that should be used when the css is not extracted (i.e. in an additional chunk when `allChunks: false`)\r\n* `loader` the loader(s) that should be used for converting the resource to a css exporting module.\r\n* `options`\r\n  * `publicPath` override the `publicPath` setting for this loader.\r\n\r\nThere is also an `extract` function on the instance. You should use this if you have more than one ExtractTextPlugin.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nMIT (http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php)\r\n","maintainers":[{"name":"bebraw","email":"bebraw@gmail.com"},{"name":"d3viant0ne","email":"wiens.joshua@gmail.com"},{"name":"ericclemmons","email":"eric@smarterspam.com"},{"name":"jhnns","email":"mail@johannesewald.de"},{"name":"sokra","email":"tobias.koppers@googlemail.com"},{"name":"spacek33z","email":"kees@webduck.nl"},{"name":"thelarkinn","email":"sean.larkin@cuw.edu"}],"time":{"modified":"2017-01-26T08:07:22.046Z","created":"2014-01-28T00:28:03.577Z","0.1.0":"2014-01-28T00:28:04.585Z","0.1.1":"2014-04-18T12:58:36.572Z","0.1.2":"2014-06-16T13:21:31.685Z","0.2.0":"2014-07-19T12:30:11.433Z","0.2.1":"2014-07-21T17:35:37.633Z","0.2.2":"2014-07-23T12:49:16.181Z","0.2.3":"2014-07-26T11:59:56.555Z","0.2.4":"2014-08-06T06:09:23.711Z","0.2.5":"2014-08-10T19:50:48.514Z","0.3.0":"2014-09-07T20:55:32.204Z","0.3.1":"2014-09-15T11:39:07.286Z","0.3.2":"2014-10-17T12:51:05.353Z","0.3.3":"2014-10-17T21:36:47.883Z","0.3.4":"2014-11-05T23:27:58.305Z","0.3.5":"2014-11-20T16:26:41.277Z","0.3.6":"2014-12-28T00:10:32.187Z","0.3.7":"2015-01-09T17:10:24.352Z","0.3.8":"2015-01-12T22:02:52.866Z","0.4.0":"2015-03-21T12:51:10.742Z","0.5.0":"2015-03-22T22:35:14.254Z","0.6.0":"2015-04-21T21:42:02.506Z","0.7.0":"2015-04-25T12:50:58.430Z","0.7.1":"2015-05-05T14:28:11.842Z","0.8.0":"2015-05-10T16:48:05.050Z","0.8.1":"2015-05-25T19:00:00.226Z","0.8.2":"2015-06-14T10:24:35.738Z","0.9.0":"2015-11-02T22:07:42.255Z","0.9.1":"2015-11-04T22:59:32.183Z","1.0.0":"2016-01-03T22:08:29.766Z","1.0.1":"2016-01-06T18:27:40.799Z","2.0.0-beta.0":"2016-07-13T07:28:59.647Z","2.0.0-beta.1":"2016-07-13T12:04:23.150Z","2.0.0-beta.2":"2016-07-15T20:17:53.559Z","2.0.0-beta.3":"2016-07-20T12:46:32.640Z","2.0.0-beta.4":"2016-09-01T20:24:31.696Z","2.0.0-beta.5":"2017-01-13T14:42:29.920Z","2.0.0-rc.0":"2017-01-26T08:07:22.046Z"},"readmeFilename":"README.md","author":{"name":"Tobias Koppers @sokra"},"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+ssh://git@github.com/webpack/extract-text-webpack-plugin.git"},"homepage":"http://github.com/webpack/extract-text-webpack-plugin","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/webpack/extract-text-webpack-plugin/issues"},"license":"MIT","users":{"fkamani":true,"nice_body":true,"sarics":true,"shangwenmo":true,"junjiansyu":true,"cestrensem":true,"sammyteahan":true,"sqrtthree":true,"dkannan":true,"foto":true,"rubiadias":true,"dhampik":true,"stone_breaker":true,"jasonwang1888":true,"philiiiiiipp":true,"ackhub":true,"yanlaichang":true,"wkaifang":true,"jetlua":true,"dudy":true,"gejiawen":true,"fadihania":true,"redstrike":true,"vipergtsrz":true,"xiaochao":true,"sternelee":true,"leonardorb":true,"guojiahao":true,"langri-sha":true,"klimnikita":true,"panos277":true,"bapinney":true,"danielbayley":true,"soulchainer":true,"jmsmrgn":true,"holly":true,"drewigg":true,"princetoad":true,"brandonb927":true},"_attachments":{},"_etag":"W/\"5889ae3a-d747\"","_lastModified":"Thu, 26 Jan 2017 08:07:22 GMT"}
